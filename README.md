### **Kytee - Chatbot 11/2024 – 12/2024**

**Technology Stack:** 

Git, Docker, FastAPI, RAG, LLM (OpenAI and Claude), Python, VectorDB 

**Project Overview:** 

This project developed a chatbot to assist companies in complying NIS2 standard by providing answers to questions. The chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull relevant information from documents and generate answers.

- Data Collection & Document Input: Collected NIS2 directive documents in English and Finnish
- RAG Implementation: Applied the RAG process, which involves chunking the documents, creating embeddings, and storing them in a vector database for efficient similarity searches.
- Generate answer using LLM: When a query is made, relevant chunks are retrieved from the VectorDB and used as context for the LLM(Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, LumiOpen) to generate an answer.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated and tested multiple models for their accuracy, response speed and costs
- API Development: Developed an API for easy to use the chatbot

### **Identifying roses using YOLO 09/2024 – 10/2024**

**Technology stack:**

LabelImg, Yolo, Python

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to assist local farms in automating the collection of rose petals and berries using a robotic arm.
- **Data Collection**: Used Python to extract RGB images and depth information from the RealSense camera.
- **Data Labeling**: Employed labeling tools to annotate the collected data for accurate model training.
- **Model Training:** Trained an object detection model that incorporates both RGB images and depth data to identify roses and measure object depth.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**
